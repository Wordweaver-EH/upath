## 5. Holistic Refinement Summary (P5.1)
The refined Generic Diachronic Structure for the Suggestion Experience captures the typical flow from initial reception to potential integration or rejection\. Key refinements involved clarifying the transition points between phases and ensuring the core GDUs represent distinct experiential shifts observed across the specific diachronic structures\. The structure now emphasizes the internal processing and reaction phases as central to the experience, often involving a dynamic interplay of cognitions, emotions, and imagination\.

**Refined GSS Summaries:**
- **GDU `GDU\_1\_Receiving\_Suggestion`:** The GSS for 'Receiving Suggestion' focuses on the initial sensory input \(auditory/visual\), immediate cognitive registration, and any initial emotional 'flavor' or bodily sensation accompanying the reception\. Refinements included adding categories for 'initial attention focus' and 'immediate sense of familiarity/novelty'\.
- **GDU `GDU\_2\_Processing\_Suggestion`:** The GSS for 'Processing Suggestion' is the most complex, detailing the internal work of evaluating, understanding, and imagining outcomes\. Refinements involved splitting 'evaluation' into 'source evaluation' and 'content evaluation', adding categories for 'internal dialogue/questioning', 'accessing relevant memories', and 'imagining potential consequences'\. This GSS heavily reflects the DV focus on cognitions and imagination\.
- **GDU `GDU\_3\_Reacting\_to\_Suggestion`:** The GSS for 'Reacting to Suggestion' captures the emergent internal stance towards the suggestion – acceptance, rejection, ambivalence, or uncertainty\. Refinements clarified the distinction between cognitive assessment \(GDU 2\) and the more holistic, often emotionally charged, internal 'leaning' or 'feeling' about the suggestion\. Categories for 'sense of internal alignment/dissonance' and 'emergent motivation/resistance' were added\.
- **GDU `GDU\_4\_Integrating\_or\_Discarding`:** The GSS for 'Integrating or Discarding' describes the state after a decision or stance has been reached\. It includes categories related to planning action \(if accepted\), feeling closure \(if discarded\), or lingering uncertainty\. Refinements focused on capturing the residual emotional and cognitive states and the shift in attention away from the suggestion itself towards future action or other concerns\.

### 5.1. Refinement Log
- **Observation:** Initial GSS for 'Processing' \(GDU\_2\) conflated evaluation of the suggestion's content with evaluation of the source\.
  - **Adjustment:** Split 'Evaluation' category in GSS\_2 into 'Evaluating Source' and 'Evaluating Content'\.
  - **Justification:** Specific SSS nodes consistently showed distinct experiential qualities and focuses depending on whether the participant was assessing the speaker's trustworthiness vs\. the idea's merit\. This split improves granularity and aligns better with cognitive models of persuasion\.

- **Observation:** Many SSS nodes in GDU\_2 described internal questioning or debate, which wasn't explicitly captured\.
  - **Adjustment:** Added 'Internal Dialogue/Questioning' category to GSS\_2\.
  - **Justification:** This represents a significant and frequent mode of processing observed in the data, distinct from simple evaluation or memory access\.

- **Observation:** The transition from GDU\_2 \(Processing\) to GDU\_3 \(Reacting\) was sometimes unclear in SDSs; the 'reaction' felt more like an emergent state than a discrete event\.
  - **Adjustment:** Refined GDU\_3 description to emphasize 'emergence of an internal stance' and added GSS\_3 categories like 'Sense of Internal Alignment/Dissonance' and 'Emergent Motivation/Resistance' to capture this felt sense\.
  - **Justification:** This better reflects the phenomenological data, where the 'decision' or 'reaction' is often experienced as a feeling or inclination solidifying, rather than a purely rational conclusion\.

- **Observation:** IV analysis showed that source credibility strongly influenced the duration and content of GDU\_2 \(Processing\) and the nature of GDU\_3 \(Reacting\)\.
  - **Adjustment:** Ensured GSS\_2 includes 'Evaluating Source' and GSS\_3 includes categories capturing the \*felt sense\* of the reaction, as high credibility often led to quicker processing and a stronger sense of alignment/motivation\.
  - **Justification:** Explicitly incorporating source evaluation and the felt sense of reaction allows the GSSs to better capture the impact of this key IV on the subjective experience\.

- **Observation:** Suggestion complexity \(IV\) correlated with the level of 'Cognitive Effort' and the frequency of 'Internal Dialogue/Questioning' nodes in GDU\_2\.
  - **Adjustment:** Included 'Cognitive Effort' and 'Internal Dialogue/Questioning' as distinct categories in GSS\_2\.
  - **Justification:** These categories are crucial for capturing the experiential load associated with processing complex suggestions, a direct link to an IV\.

### 5.2. Emergent Insights
- Insight\_1: The 'Processing Suggestion' phase \(GDU\_2\) is not purely cognitive; it is deeply intertwined with emergent emotional and somatic states, particularly those related to perceived alignment or dissonance with one's self-concept or values\.
- Insight\_2: The transition to 'Reacting to Suggestion' \(GDU\_3\) is often marked by a shift from analytical thought to a more holistic, felt sense of 'rightness' or 'wrongness' about the suggestion, frequently accompanied by specific bodily sensations\.
- Insight\_3: Imagination plays a critical role in GDU\_2, not just in simulating outcomes but also in accessing and re-experiencing relevant past memories, which directly influences evaluation and subsequent reaction\.
- Insight\_4: The impact of IVs like source credibility and suggestion complexity is experientially traceable, affecting not just \*whether\* a suggestion is accepted, but \*how\* it is processed and \*what\* it feels like to process and react to it \(e\.g\., high credibility reduces cognitive effort and increases positive felt sense in GDU\_3\)\.

### 5.3. Initial Hypotheses (from P5)
- PhenoHyp\_1: The intensity of 'Sense of Internal Alignment/Dissonance' \(GSS\_3\) is positively correlated with the vividness and emotional charge of 'Imagining Potential Consequences' \(GSS\_2\) that align or conflict with the suggestion\.
- PhenoHyp\_2: Experiences categorized as 'Cognitive Effort' \(GSS\_2\) are consistently accompanied by specific somatic sensations \(GSS\_2 'Associated Sensations'\), such as tension in the head, eyes, or shoulders\.
- PhenoHyp\_3: When 'Evaluating Source' \(GSS\_2\) results in a judgment of low credibility, the subsequent 'Emergent Motivation/Resistance' \(GSS\_3\) will predominantly be resistance, regardless of the 'Evaluating Content' outcome\.
- PhenoHyp\_4: The presence and nature of 'Internal Dialogue/Questioning' \(GSS\_2\) mediate the relationship between 'Suggestion Complexity' \(IV\) and the duration of the 'Processing Suggestion' phase \(GDU\_2\)\.

### 6.3. Formal Causal Hypotheses (P7.5)
#### Hypothesis: `Causal\_H1`
- **Claim:** Source Credibility \(X\_SourceCred\) causally influences Final Stance/Decision \(Y\_FinalStance\), mediated sequentially by Evaluating Source \(M\_EvalSource\) and Sense of Internal Alignment/Dissonance \(M\_AlignmentDiss\)\.
- **Concept:** Sequential Mediation
- **Formal Query:** `E\[Y\_FinalStance \| do\(X\_SourceCred=high\)\] \!= E\[Y\_FinalStance \| do\(X\_SourceCred=low\)\] via path X\_SourceCred -> M\_EvalSource -> M\_AlignmentDiss -> Y\_FinalStance`
- **Testable Prediction:** Increasing the perceived Source Credibility is predicted to lead to a more favorable Final Stance, and this effect is expected to be significantly attenuated or eliminated if M\_EvalSource and M\_AlignmentDiss are controlled for or fixed\.

#### Hypothesis: `Causal\_H2`
- **Claim:** Suggestion Complexity \(X\_SuggestComplex\) directly causes increased Cognitive Effort \(M\_CogEffort\)\.
- **Concept:** Direct Causal Effect
- **Formal Query:** `E\[M\_CogEffort \| do\(X\_SuggestComplex=high\)\] > E\[M\_CogEffort \| do\(X\_SuggestComplex=low\)\]`
- **Testable Prediction:** Suggestions rated as higher in complexity are predicted to result in higher reported levels of Cognitive Effort during processing\.

#### Hypothesis: `Causal\_H3`
- **Claim:** Understanding Content \(M\_Understand\) causally influences Sense of Internal Alignment/Dissonance \(M\_AlignmentDiss\), mediated by Imagining Consequences \(M\_Imagine\)\.
- **Concept:** Mediation
- **Formal Query:** `E\[M\_AlignmentDiss \| do\(M\_Understand=high\)\] \!= E\[M\_AlignmentDiss \| do\(M\_Understand=low\)\] via path M\_Understand -> M\_Imagine -> M\_AlignmentDiss`
- **Testable Prediction:** Improving the clarity and ease of Understanding Content is predicted to influence the Sense of Internal Alignment/Dissonance, and this effect is expected to be mediated by the nature and vividness of Imagined Consequences\.

#### Hypothesis: `Causal\_H4`
- **Claim:** Sense of Internal Alignment/Dissonance \(M\_AlignmentDiss\) directly influences the nature or intensity of Associated Bodily State \(GDU3\) \(M\_AssocBodilyG3\)\.
- **Concept:** Direct Causal Effect
- **Formal Query:** `E\[M\_AssocBodilyG3 \| do\(M\_AlignmentDiss=dissonance\)\] \!= E\[M\_AssocBodilyG3 \| do\(M\_AlignmentDiss=alignment\)\]`
- **Testable Prediction:** Experiencing greater internal dissonance is predicted to be directly associated with specific, potentially distinct, bodily sensations in the final reaction phase \(GDU3\), compared to experiencing alignment\.
