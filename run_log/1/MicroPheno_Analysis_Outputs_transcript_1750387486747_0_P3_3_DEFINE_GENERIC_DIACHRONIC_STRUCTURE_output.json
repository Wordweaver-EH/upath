  "variants_summary": "The structure of the suggestion experience is strongly influenced by the suggestion score (effectiveness). High-scoring suggestions (4-5/5) typically feature a structure centered around 'GDU_Suggested_Phenomenon_Success', describing the unfolding experience, its qualities, and progression. Reflection ('GDU_Reflection_Metacognition') in these cases focuses on the nature of the successful experience (e.g., automaticity, reality). Low-scoring suggestions (0-1/5) are characterized by the prominence of 'GDU_Attempt_Strategy' and 'GDU_Suggested_Phenomenon_Absence', detailing the process of trying, the lack of the expected outcome, or unrelated internal events ('GDU_Unrelated_Cognitive_Activity'). Reflection ('GDU_Reflection_Metacognition') in low-score cases focuses on the absence, difficulty, or strategies used. 'GDU_Orientation_Preparation' is common across all scores as a starting point. 'GDU_Transition_Shift' can appear in various contexts.",
